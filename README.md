This is my package repo for [s6-networking](http://www.skarnet.org/software/s6-networking/), a set of network tools by [Laurent Bercot](http://skarnet.org/).

The `upstream/` directory is taken directly from upstream. The rest of the repository is my packaging scripts for compiling a distributable build.
